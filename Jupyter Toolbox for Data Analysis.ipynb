    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook (IMO) is the ideal environment for data analysis. It works as follows.\n",
    "- You type code into cells. \n",
    "- You run the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "By breaking the code into cells it allows you to work in steps and investigate the data as you are going.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook has two modes:\n",
    "- Command mode (let's you create new cells, delete them, run them etc.)\n",
    "- Edit mode (let's you type into and edit the cells)\n",
    "\n",
    "Escape takes you to command mode (the highlighted cell will have a blue bar on the left),  Enter takes you to edit mode (the highlighted cell will have a green bar on the left).\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are buttons at the top, I'd highly recommend learning the shortcuts. Aside from those two the most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command Mode:**\n",
    "- a: create a cell above\n",
    "- b: create a cell below\n",
    "- Cmd/Ctrl+Enter - Runs a cell\n",
    "- dd: deletes a cell (be careful, you can't undo this)\n",
    "- m: Set a cell to text mode (markdown), like this cell you're reading\n",
    "- y: Set a cell to code mode (the default)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit mode:**\n",
    "- shift+tab: show documentation for the function the cursor is inside. Hit tab multiple times to change where the documentation pop-up appears. (sometimes won't trigger in which case just google \"pandas documentation x\")\n"
